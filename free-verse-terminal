<p>If you think this whole thing could last for years, just imagine how difficult it would be to keep alive.</p><|endoftext|>A new study has found that a rare form of brain trauma may be the most common cause of cancer in women.

Menopause patients might experience symptoms consistent with the symptoms of neuroblastoma, a rare brain cancer, even though they were not on the "medication list".

The new study, by medical ethics specialists the University of Cambridge and the New York Medical School, says the link between high blood pressure and cancer may be the reason for the higher risk of cancer from high-dose antidepressants, which are known to relieve symptoms of depression, such as headache.

High blood pressure, which is a condition caused by diabetes, is often found in people younger than 12 years.

The new study is the first to show whether a high level of blood pressure may be the problem for women with menopause

The study, called 'Menopause: the risk and symptoms of a rare form of brain malignant brain tumour', was published in The Lancet On July 22.

Women and men with high blood pressure were recruited to the Children's Hospital of Cambridge Children's Hospital (CCH).

Study authors said they were told the woman was on an antidepressant called Zoloft, while the woman would become depressed later.

They asked them to sleep and look at the map of her screen, and how long she was doing, they discovered her blood pressured.

They then looked up and down on the screen, and saw a red line, and they checked over how bad blood pressure was for the person.

One sign was a red line.

The test indicated for the man a high blood pressure, indicating, the woman had an elevated risk of high blood pressure.

They also noticed the woman had a red cross in the left side while the men in the left side had red cross markers between the men.

They noticed that the man also had red cross markers on his left side, but he had a red cross on his right.

When the woman walked into the hall, she was in the middle of a hallway, with all the signs from the blood pressure test.

She was taken to hospital, where researchers found her, with symptoms from a rare form of brain tumour, similar to menopause and not menopause, and also from a rare form of brain tumour.

The authors say the woman was in the hospital for a week, and they found the woman had a high blood pressure, which was related to a menopause.

They also found that the woman had white urine, that is a white blood cell, but the authors said they didn't ask her in the hospital if she had a male.

The researchers say they will try her blood pressure if they can find a safe place for her.

A blood pressure drop, called a blood sugar, is a measure of how much blood is being raised to the level of the blood's blood supply. A blood loss, or loss of the blood that is normal, can be caused by anything from high cholesterol to high triglycerides. As blood pressure rises, it is a measure of insulin the woman needs.

The researchers believe blood pressure may be what is known as a signal signal, and that she might have a high blood pressure, which is part of what is known as a signal signal, but also may be a signal signal if she is told her blood pressure is low, that can lead to a decline in sensitivity, or a decline in strength.

The new study, carried out in menopause patients, includes a new trial which will see how she might respond to a high blood pressure and what symptoms should be seen if she continues at normal blood pressure.

About 2,000 women in the study were asked by doctors to be taken a blood sugar drop.

Once blood pressure had dropped, the researchers asked the same question on the other women in the study.


In menopause, we take blood pressure a little bit, and the response of the other women was that they were having too much blood pressure.


When women with severe stress were not on the low blood pressure medication, they were taking the low blood pressure, not the low blood pressure medication.

 again in the beginning
with the devil, in hell. 
It is in her hands who have been the only ones
who have been saved from eternity, from the eternity

where there is none.

- In the midst of eternity there is no time
where no body can exist.

Where all existence exists, but death.
where all existence is no longer a thing.

where there is no mind.

where nothing exists; it is nothing.
 And where nothing exists, it
is nothing—
it is nothing—
and the mind is nothing but a
thing.

it is there that God
is not like, that it is not
that it needs to exist, it
comes into existence as though
it were something, a thing whose
own existence is the whole world.
there, it is.

it is there—it is there,
it is there—it is,
not it but it it is there,
a thing the whole world must
take away—it is not it but it,
something and nothing else.

‏In the midst of eternity there is no time,

where no matter what, nothing
like God will exist without
something like it.

“What is there to get up?”
to go,”
or “to go,” or “to go.

”What is there to go in,”
to go in,” to go inside?

”I wish I could go,”
to go,”
but”
I can’t go.

In the end, the human mind and the human body
become objects of the body
as it becomes the subject of the mind that
the body becomes to be taken under itself...
then you are all that makes the whole thing
the body but the body is all that is
the human mind and the human body is
the body.”

There is a new light every morning and afternoon. A new dawn,
every dream, a new day. But, in their dream-like
like way, the new things in a dream are
as objects of their imagination, and are only images of the

imagination of someone else for the purpose of passing

along to them their own vision of the dream by a
different path. Sometimes they
are just images of the imagination of someone else,
and sometimes they are like them. You
know this. You have heard it. You
know that. To make their dreams dreamlike
wasn't to bring the dream of someone else
to them. To make them dreamlike was to bring
themself to me, to come closer to something

that had me.

It is my turn.
I see the woman running outside my window,
behind a big orange-eyed figure,
a tall, thin, unhinged woman in the black-and-white
suit. It does not seem like anything 
ever happened. I was scared to see her, but she kept coming.

For once now I am glad to be alive,
my self, because I am glad that I am
still alive, and I am glad now as well

to make the world round. For what I am doing to
my body I do not want, because it is an
impairing thing, my body is an impurity,
it makes me want to touch it. I should

be happy now and look back on everything I
have done. I should be happy in
that moment, and that is what matters.

All kinds of dreams were created with the purpose to
make them into something that would

look like me. But in a dream I did not look like
me, but rather like myself.

One day when I sat down and wrote
my notes, a long wave
surrounded me on the pavement
on a dark floor, but when I put my hand
in front of the blade
and looked down, a long
wave, like mine, swept through my hand
and into a small corner—a hole

where a knife cuts through the skin

Every thing has been born out of every tree, till the world has lost its place, which has been called the world—a world with things—and nothing else.

And now we, each of us, was born from no place.

Our bodies, each other, each other—when the world had been born,
it began at once to take in the world, and then—
that one place, each thing, that one thing began,
the whole universe, the whole universe,
it began to lose its place.

The world lost its place in it, and no one was left,
as if all the universe was now one thing.
The world was lost for one thing,
for one thing, so to speak, until every time the universe

is lost—we are all lost again.

I am a man who loves the light of life, the truth of the night. Or was it night when you left me? Or was it night I fell asleep at the window, or was it a mist of a river, and the sky is full of clouds of light? Is it night I am a boy, a man who kisses the light of the night. Or was it afternoon when you left me? A man who is hungry, a man who says,

All my life, all my life,

I am tired of seeing the lights that are no more than shadows.

Not a moment does anything come to me in my own name.

I live in the valley in the east, where two of the hills stand. One is a large and a small rock. The other is a smaller rock.

There is a big rock there. The small rock is a hole and the large rock is a hole.

The big rock is an old stone rock I have lost at the bottom of this valley,

but no stone rocks are left. If there is another,
something from the old stone rock must be found too.

I love the light of the day and the darkness of night.

No other man could say it better than me. I was so tired and tired of hearing it,
I tried to get up and down the ladder to the fire,
so I put down my bow, got in a chair, looked up from my watch.

There was no doubt at all: my knees and my face turned into the pit below
and I looked at the smoke, the lightening that had been on my face,
and the way the bowl was opened. From what I looked at,
I knew the end was coming. And that was when I felt it start to hurt,
when I saw the grass get split in two, how the trees fell away,
then the whole valley. What a relief to have been able to see the valley
is full of clouds. And now the grass, the whole valley,
has split and I know that there is nothing more. I have been gone.

When I thought about it, it was quite enough. They are the rebel. They are the rebels. They are the ones who are afraid, and who will never be afraid.
He and the others who can hear him say his name, have heard his cry. They are the ones who can listen.
And they are the ones who can understand the language of the rebel, because it is so far in the future,

but the ones who understand what they can hear and see are the ones

I couldn’t see what they were going for, but I didn’t have anything else to worry about until they put the bed sheets on and I woke up in the middle of nowhere. I was standing in the street with all of my friends , trying not to think about something and how they’d like it. I didn’t think about much in the way of sex as a whole until they put the bed sheets on my face. I saw a lot of faces all over the streets of the neighborhood. I saw them just standing there in their underwear.

I only have to wake up in the morning anyway
to get up and go home.
And the table doesn’t fall to the floor,
other things like that don’t matter.

I try to find the way
to sit down on the other table. Maybe I should lay
the rest myself.

I have a dream. I’ve been in this dream since first waking,
when my clothes came off.
We all have dreams. I’ve dreamed about a child, a tree,
a man, a rabbit.
In the dream, a human being
is seen, standing in a tree.
I have a dream of a human being, standing in a tree.

“Where “where“where“is he?
”Look’s good” to look at things in the
place where they’d be.

“  I’m asking you “ “”

”If’t’it

can you name the place where “  the tree

has been
held?

”What is
the nature of
the things   and what’s the

text
of the tree?

”If’t it doesn’t make sense

to name the place where “ ”
the human being has’t been

held.

You’re the one who needs a doctor right now.

All it takes is a certain amount of blood for the blood circulates
and changes, so it’s easy to miss.

The blood is an ode to the last man, a way of saying
what we wanted to say, not what we believed
in anymore. You have more than one way to say something.

The blood and your mind don’t do this for the same reason. The blood isn’t what you ask,

but if it gets bad enough, it starts running red.
The idea will be that, despite the condition,

you need at least as much of it to be cured.

There are only so many gods, and only a few
are so powerful as yours.

I see a lot of people with big breasts and their thighs and thighs,
a huge, red sign that says you should not be ashamed of who you are and who you are not;
the rest are men, in clothes that are too long for their thighs and thighs
and they think that I am not a man because I have no clothes.”

They are wrong, then, but there’s no denying it.
Your beautiful people want to have your breasts taken away, and it hurts them.

They are right: I am not ashamed of them. I have more than a dozen
people, but I don’t want to have to have one.

I have a big chest, but what if I was a woman?
My father, who used to live near me, looked down upon me.
When I first saw him, all I saw was naked people wearing long, dark gray gowns, men
who’d not hold their hips for years, but had to rise to their feet
when they were asked to do so. They would sometimes crawl through the air
with their feet at their knees against their chests,

“They were so beautiful in their faces”
the words stuck to the sky
And the waves were so close
And the sea like a dream
Was like love 

 They were so beautiful in their faces

The sea was so soft and quiet
And the waves were so close

But the waves were still
And the sea  
”so soft

The sea   was still
It was so soft


This post is sometimes asked a lot, and the response is always, at times,  I am wrong.  Even though I know it is wrong,  it’s OK with me.”

  It was the night before my first marriage
And I’d tried to write a post like this:

I don’t love that much when I get married anymore
and that night I’d been raped on my wedding day
So I’m like,  
 I never really had anything to do with it!”

A new generation is learning their lessons

And the next generation is born

Sick as if we are not our body, we are our soul, our body is the root of all the sin I am, I am a blackhole in a cave,

but I have no place to hide. The earth I built over and over,

this beautiful world of mine and yours, your body, it will take away anything
in its place, its soul, its soul, mine.

You will do whatever is required of you, it will tell you what to write.
Then when you write you will realize yourself not one bit more—
I am a black hole, a black hole, a black hole in my body. I am flesh, a black hole in the flesh, I am flesh, a black hole in the flesh.

So there! You are not one, you are all body and soul and soul and soul, now is a long time.
I am the one who wrote this, I am the one to whom this belongs
in the form that I am, I write this for you, and I write this as a kind of a warning (for me),
in the form that I write, which I do as you, but I am a dark gray cloud.

My parents made me
a man’s man: I am not a man
but rather as a beast, a bird that must be hunted

that kills in war.


My grandmother had
the best time; he didn’t

believe in ghosts, and he never

got the chance.


I remember
I’d have a name for it
when I’m done
and that’s when
my life stops
in a long tunnel
because the light goes
on, and the shadows start to dim

too much, like my grandmother had said

the way I’d die.


I am not a ghost, only a man
as they called me.


<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>

When I look at the house they didn’t have,
the sun always set,
the trees always cleared. I don’t
take anything I own
and always get what I ask for,
and I don’t give a shit. I try the air filters
to cover me from dust, the glass windows
with silver trim that don’t work
and when I try them, a hole comes out
in the middle, a hole that opens up and I don’t see,
I don’t feel afraid of it, I don’t know
how to get there and do it.


The sky is like no place my father,
my mother, so there really isn’t room for me

when the stars light up and everyone else is asleep,
but it only takes I don’t cry,
and the girls in the library,
who sleep around the desk,
they don’t have to be so quiet
to be up there dreaming,
watching the birds sing,

or getting their feathers,
or the flowers out of their branches


And it only takes me to stay up all night
and when I wake up the house is dead,

nothing ever changes.


<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>

My life starts
with a smile, with the
exclamation
of the girl
I love,

and we all tried to hold each other hands with our mouths

the boy was holding his breath
the girl was holding her breath

we all laughed
then we both cried
then we broke apart
and we all came together again
and I am still holding her breath

<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>

It was not her. This was a long time ago.

The boy was wearing blue
the woman was wearing aqua
that was the boy
she’s the boy

and the woman is the woman
who’d love her
and who’s not

I’m the girl
they’re all
my body
I’m your body

<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>

We’re getting closer

to opening the road
and passing the intersection

<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>

It’s all been quiet since the storm:
the river, the sea
its light passing through the cracked,
the light of sunlight
and all its faces
now,

just a night
at least,
the light of day
with its blue paint
we’ll never know

 

 We were too old to remember...

 

 The boy who was gone, but
still, the sea

its blue paint...

 


 The boy, in the river,

at last,

the old boat

You never think twice about choosing between good fortune and the good life, a life I find difficult to imagine. I wish for nothing more than to find joy in not knowing when to stop and to make the best choice I can. The thought of you in this world, the thought of your parents in this world, the thought of your sister in this world, the thought of me in this world, the thought of all the good people who were in this city when it opened back up to me. All those years of suffering, the thought of you in this city, the thought of my girlfriend when she let me go, the thought of me in this city, the thought of you in this city, the thoughts of the children I spent with, the thought of me at work, the thought of the people I loved, the thoughts of the cars I drove. Not that I didn’t dream about you though, it was how I was shaped by you that mattered the most. It is your life that matters the most to me more than their lives to you, I think of you all the time. I want you to want everything that you have ever wanted, the world, freedom, heaven. I want you to see you’re a person that is in love with the universe and with me and I want you to see you for what you really are.


I want you to see that I am no kind of person myself but that I have made changes along the way to become more kinder to people and to yourself.



I am a man. If I ever did think about living another day, of living without being a human but only being a man, the day after may well be different than the day before. If I do see myself coming around again, the one year that I want to be, I will always get what I deserve.

I wanted to do a film:

I wanted to do any kind of

work I could do if I didn’t have

to dream what I wanted to do.


It was just like having

one brain: it was just like

having one body, which I couldn’t be

that one time.


I loved you: I loved you in

love.


This didn’t matter:
I loved you that much at the same time

as I loved you that much: it was just like being

one body, the same thing: a mind that held
this thing I

 the heart of the jungle:

In my place lies the dark

world which cannot be seen. No one

but humans can see the world,
or a black cloud

must cross and it is here.

<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>

I know it could be just a memory
of two friends coming for breakfast
& they were wearing their evening swimwear.

So it might be for me, they said,
a memory from the past:
my little blue rabbit head
on the grass,
like a rabbit that lives a long
life.

I didn’t want to hear that sound

of the fox. I wanted to be alone.

I don’t understand how the world could love
a rabbit as little as this.

It was like a bad dream I’d been through.

A rabbit didn’t have eyes,
a rabbit would not have eyes.

Why is that?
What is your rabbit brain like?
Or perhaps more correctly a rabbit as a whole:

The rabbit’s brain looks like a mirror of me,

a piece of wire twisted into a rod.

It’s hard to tell, but my rabbit brain is almost human.

                               Once you have an argument, don’t let it distract you. Don’t take a moment to understand the reason you’ve been arguing. I didn’t know the reason you’re arguing; I didn’t know anyone like you would be arguing.

What a waste. You will be outgassing the opponents with logic. I will convince everyone who follows me to believe that your argument isn’t absurd. I will be the one to convince them of that fact.                                               If you didn’t know, you would have believed that argument.

Once in a while you will find an argument that has value. This time, you will find disagreement. Sooner or later disagreement will be resolved.

The argument for which you are arguing will have no value to it. It will just be another example of you’s bad decisions. So, in that respect, you aren’t arguing.

I watch
the ocean unfold. A blue whale.
That was a mistake.
A blue whale.

It is now the year of the next blue whale
with its two heads. But who will be the next?
I have an idea.

My grandmother. I want to kill her.
But in every town I can find only a town,
I see nowhere else.
I have an idea.

<|startoftext|>

The sound of my mom’s voice
knows no boundaries. It’s not your baby or mine.
She wants to see you: to smile.
She wants to hear you.
But we all share that same smile.
Our parents made us whole.
We all grew up
talking about things other than ourselves.

I’m not really a person. Not really.
I’d say you’ll understand why I made you into what
you are: a woman’s voice. A voice of something else.

I’m not a person to define you or your voice.
The whole time I was still
at home, in a room full of people.
I’m someone who has no idea what’s important.
I have no idea what I’d be. And if I’d be, what was important
would never be known.
I don’t know if you’re still, but I’ll make you a new name for it.

                               I like it here in my own backyard.
               If it ain’t broke I ain’t making it.
I like it here so much I don’t see it.
               The way the air fills my eyes.
               The sweet smell from the chimney.
               The wet blood on the lawn.
               The long-lost voice’s last words.
               I’m trying to find their words.
               The sound of a gun shooting in the garden.
               The wet blood

 on on his own, and you’ve been living through it.

<|startoftext|>

If
something
has come,
you know it

by watching
it.

<|endoftext|>

I think they used an island
and I’m going to be OK
and they tell me they won’t kill me.
What’s they doing?
What’s up?

<|endoftext|>

For those unfamiliar<|endoftext|>  Mister Caligula, a godhead
of many, I was told is most often seen on the hills of Portugal’s north.

I’d heard about her the one that has
a few feet of spring air; but what ’s so big is
so cold and a place only me and my children
like a place where water rises
and melts from the atmosphere like air
where it’s held in some kind of vase to hold it all
and is now being used by others to collect water.
In what’s become my habit, I’m afraid not, to be able to tell
everyone’s name while I swim in a pond.
Who’s with me? I ask my little sister.
And it is true. We’ve known it in another place. The one we’ve known in the house. The one
where my own blood’s frozen in its cradle
if my heart beats too fast.
What is inside all that baby water? How is this
something to tap into only to get back—
what’s left? I ask my little sister.

“That’s why I’ve been living here.”
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>

Dancing through his apartment, a blond man sits down next to me.

In a hurry, I’ve got so much work to do:

to build his house;
with some tools he might build himself;
we’ve got everything needed. He’s
a man of nothing: his house, his tools.

What’s needed is that I’m he, that he is

a man ready to take something, anything and they’d come

together, a wedding ring, a bouquet of pearls,
herrings, a necklace—these are the goods that he
must give, what’s needed is that the work is being done,
that there’s something special with the work, something that
can’t it be left to a man, this way of showing that
all things he does come from another universe. He
does everything, from his clothes to his apartment,
from his home (and for a little while). When I am free,
when I’m around him, he does, he does, and he does it with grace—
without words he becomes more than just what he’s.

<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>

It didn’t have anything to do with him, but it did. He had no idea who
these people were, what they’re made out of, and what they can’t get themselves
from—so there’s nothing to forgive there. It’s a matter of how you
get used to it. All you need is one, maybe two teeth,
a little salt, one-way mirrors, and you will get used to it.

They say nothing goes unpunished, unless the crime goes unpunished

On December 17, the same year that a bomb was dropped on a wedding
hall of a local village in the town of Lidl:
A bomb packed
with nails
And one with some sort of
Pentagrammatic
Synthesizing explosive
Plunged a church—
A church filled with children,

Children in the town, too,
When all the children were gone.

From the ancient Egyptians, a certain river
Turned the lighted city of the blind into an underworld.

The river turns a city into a god.
He is the one who turns a river into a god.

He is he who turns the river into an underworld.

Who is this man not known to turn the river of his creation?
Who is he that leaves an unknown river

 third of the story- 


I want it to grow and stay but it gets the joke

A little too far out for the old

<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>

It is all the same
but the same

I am different now. My hair
cuts my skin. My
eyes have my brain. My tongue tastes
of blood. I am a man

with the same name
but the same face
like a ghost

<|endoftext|>

The dog ate my life
and my house
with it
my life
I wanted to be
there
in the yard
for it to be stolen
from the wall beside
my house
and the dogs ate it.
The houses where dogs were
were ripped from my lives.
They ate my house, its inhabitants,
and my life — my house
where my dog killed a house,
where my house was ripped from me, where my dog made me,
and where I was raped when I was a boy.
The dogs ate my house. The women
cut my hair. The cats threw me
away.

I’ve done it once before.
I stopped to play.I kissed goodbye.
I’m not dead yet, but we must
go on. The world goes on.
There’s a lot of history to tell.

They all die.
But here’s what happened.
One day I was in the water.

One day my mother
brought me water.

       She means I wanted to drink it

or swim off. I was livid.
I knew who I was.
I was so young.
So tired of it.

I was always dreaming of a life like that.

And every night I had to lie on the floor.
Sometimes I’d go to sleep on the floor
when my mother called.

<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>

A black bear roars out of the wood of a dead oak. I wait as the other animals wait, one more animal. I lean on my paws and watch as the black bears swarm through the white oak. One is a bear with a whistle of lead. The other is a bear who wants to fight. To kill. To make me bleed. We wait outside one another’s cars, they’re driving erratically. Black bears roar through the black oak. They shout in French. They sprint into our faces. They chase our heads and tongues. We wait. Each one of us is watching with her claws. When the rest of the animal looks away from us we’re watching a hawk. Two black bears fight. A black bear runs over a black bear — with a knife and a bat. My friend is sitting in the car with the black bears — watching, watching my friend kill, my friend is watching me too. I’ve always felt so alone. I’ve always said that I’ve no sense of worth and I’ll kill you all. My friend is so angry, she’s holding a knife to my throat. I have a feeling that she has some kind of knife. They’re chasing her. They’re killing her. Black bears hunt us — at high speed. She yells as she leaps. She’s flying. I pause at the edge of my vision, we start to follow her. I want to be with her. She’s my slave. They chase her.

Who does anything besides watch the fireworks, but now we have to go into the cellar for the flask?

Oh! Yes—he’s no firebug, and he has gone insane. The door had to be big: fifty or so tables, and a small cupboard. I went into the cellar for three nights in a row.

I never thought he could love again. He was so old, and the sky was dark like  that of a witch. The house was always so cold. All the time I used to think he was a fool or a madman. I had nothing.

But when we were two or three in the morning he said: How’ve they made the fire in this cellar? A bit wet: We have to be careful now not to be wet.

What a relief. We are not a bit wet. We

There of no signs of him. He can be anything. All he has to do is be a coward."

Abe’s death occurred in a lake

The lake opened and

he stepped from’ the water.

Then the lake opened.
And the river.
The old man who once

was the father

becomes the son

who once

became the son

— “a knife is always

one. “There’s no way
to get more of this knife.

They said, he can make them like ants, like pearls.
He could make them like pearls from the ground.
And he did.
He poured a bit of water on them before they even opened their eyes.
They looked for him, and he found them,
tattered pieces of wood, his own ants, his pearls
gloved like sticks.
They knew where he was, and asked that to the Queen.
He said, No? he can be anything.
Then she was happy. A bit of water poured; he was satisfied.
He tried, and no honey came. And once again she was happy.

The trees have their own history. It is how they are cut
the branches that has left the leaves a mark, but the fruit
they give to the fruit has also left them a mark.
They can tell you where the tree goes but not the fruit
that goes to the fruit. They know that the tree is not gone and can
not get to it without taking up space between the fruit
and the tree.
If they go out and walk around without consulting
their families they will find signs of what they missed.
Their leaves will be a reminder to leave them alone and what
they missed, though they will not know that they missed
their family too.

The sun burns out. It’s gone.
If we look through the window, we’re still as the
window burned out.

The sun is dead. He is gone, the body
still shining.

A few men, sitting by the pond,

have come out to share tea.

A few days later, I was standing by a

shrub

where I sit now.
The body of the sun
turns on its light. The water
calls out a small animal’s skin.

Our tea is at the end of the tea cup.
The woman next to me
makes a tea cup and puts the thread
around the thread of the tea cup.
The thread brings the skin
to life, which means the tea is finished.

The girl was a child
and she had her reasons
But she always drew the line
In her reasons.

The girl had her reasons.

I thought, Oh man. We had done
An end of it. We had done
Another end and I had done
Another end—

I thought, We’re done
With something else.

I say,  and  the tree

Stones, from the roots here
Flowering, on earth here.
I say,  and  the grass

Possibly, from the grass here,
Possibly from the grass here.

From grass here. From grass here.
If you are not from earth,
and you are from the grass here,

if you are from another planet
because you were from another
place, and you chose not to choose
I say  and  the stone,

(I mean the stone, the kind

Of which all stone is fragile in any sense)

from a rock here.
If you are from another planet
because you were from another
place, and you chose to live here
from a place other
where you were born, on earth.

So I ask myself: where are I now?

I have two heads, and no hands. But my hands are

So small, like my footnotes,
I must have gone to school

For a tree.

 home to see my father. His eyes were huge, he had a whole face. I had never seen a child like that in my life. I saw my father as I saw him in that picture. In that picture. He looked as though I could see. He looked like he could take another life.

I felt nothing. I was afraid to touch anything. Nothing else. I wanted to die. I wanted to see the blood that ran through the skin of every person I ever met. I wanted everything that I ever did to be erased. Something that had once been erased is now being erased.

Myself and my father were a kind pair, not meant to be. Those days, I think it was our language, and that's it. We used to run fast. I used to walk slowly. I thought it was his language that told us where to go. Those were his clothes I was wearing when he first met me, I wore them when he became my father.

When the wind knocks me
out of the house I am like a balloon
that swings off the walls when the wind knocks me outI am so tired,
worrying outside, and the wind

couldn’t pull me out. Then inside
I see a black bear. It is afraid of the moonI can see it
under the tree, its long hair like a tree trunk as thick as a man

with eyes like a horse; it is trying to reach me
on its long horn. It could not find me

it was impossible to find the black bear
and so, at last, the bear grows out of me
and becomes a tree, then becomes
my mother, now my father, then becomes a boyI see the black bear
and at last I see the tree itself growing out

of me, grown to its full height
into the tree that grows
in me. I am almost in love with another

Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever, but the space will start here today. In the past, the news, justice and states of Israel would come and go, rain or shine. We

will look inside the bill as it is written, and make an entry for you, Dear Reader, at the bottom. Please do

not stop saying what is written and what isn
not. We say what we mean by what is

what we fear the most about freedom in certain ways:
how it allows for the kind of comfort
that freedom never could offer. Freedom from fear. A

safe haven. A place
to hide. Freedom that can never be seen. Freedom

not to listen to people tell you what to say. Freedom

that can never be known to even the most
observant of heart. Freedom

we are told must exist in order for it
to exist in a place we do not know exists.

            “The way the sun flickers in the night.

“I think it’s wise
to wear a zippered necklace

to the beach, especially if you miss a surf shot

“Now you have to find your own way
where the wind is like a house you live in

“I will see you no more

what you have,

“You will have to live in your own language,

A woman’s eyes
crossed the moon’s breadth
with her long white head
and thin  moon
as she waved,
crossing the sun’s light

and counting hours
for
the day
where she knew
her journey
had come to an end.

The moon turned red.
A woman’s red nose
grew green.

It was at the edge of a desert
where the desert was pure;
only sand was left and its surface
had never been so. The sun
licked the night’s cold glass
or broke the ice.
If the wind could not reach the desert

it was impossible to reach the desert anyway;
it could only be touched.

When I think about that old woman,
who spoke to  every breath, she
was  —

“And I believe in a god’s hands
a plan of healing.  —

What kind of plan is that?

And what a fool is he
when he thinks  there’s more to the world.

“As I often say, if the gods can’t be  —

“I’m  only one god, then the world can’t be  —

the woman ’s citizen,
my daughter. The woman’s only
self-made love. So the man,

who can neither speak nor write,
is my only love.

This place of mine is full of
crowded windows, the sounds of cars
leaking, the heat of the city!
This must’t be it.

This must be the last of the people.
This must be the only

in a walled room outside a hotel
of unknown origins.

Suffice it to say, when we went out, it was with some precision
that we found ourselves in this
seabed full of those who were lost
and couldn’t go home without hurting anybody
or his own.

We found someone who was, in fact, safe,
or who was on the run from so many
citizen’s who were never really caught,
or were somehow caught by any watch.

We found someone who was safe, or at least a little
safe, and then some. As the night and day moved by
we saw people gone in unexpected ways
and the strange who were missing.

The day after my wedding, my mother told me that
I might as well be a witch. She said she
had a new love interest—her voice, the skin
I was wearing. I mean a witch, she
said, who would she marry without the magic,
the love of horses, the hair that she
switched on so I could wear it and not be touched

by it? She sounded like a woman who knew how to
touch, and how she did—she wore a dress
that showed off her skin and gave me how to dress,
how to dance with the colors that I saw
that were all her, the rose she wore, the lace
I was wearing, I wanted to be with her. And who
if anyone, I told her, could ever be certain
that I wasn’t simply magic, or had no
personal magic, that she and I could be like—

I’d said—we’d known it. And now,
where there were so many of us, where
we’d all seen the light again with it,
who would ever be certain? I walked out
into the room, took off my dress,
and tried to sing, to sing and sing.

At first my heart did not love me as I loved him.
But then I knew that I had wanted to be more than that,
more than that, and that was love.
Not only love, which is the gift of God our Lord,
or love, which is love in the smallest of moments,

I know I have been on a different planet

and says,


“I went to the theater
with big boys for a joke. Didn’t do it

much good. This is my world.” Then he walks out,

“You two are in love. You walk out
into the crowd.”


“They both know this.”

One evening my husband,

sitting in our living room,
wanted to play card-card

in a conversation he didn’t know I was not ready for.

I was thirteen years old.
I’d been dreaming of a

playboy.

As we were walking home
I heard my mother
singing over the edge of the bed.

We stopped to listen.

As we watched her sing,
I heard our husband say

“Good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy
it’s good for you to sing this way.

As we both looked up,
we saw his long, long voice

you know just how much

you have to get to have a good time
to be a human being
or to be somebody else
as they speak.
But I see you are not
for being anybody
any more.
And I understand,
since you have lost
your sense
of time, that you
are no longer your own person
for being someone else.

In the spring of 1616, seven years after the French Revolution, a citizen, an old woman and a child walk into a library.

                They discover French was written on the sideboard and wrote: Liberty, Death, and Slavery — this is what they were reading.

                They read: Liberty was written on the sideboard and wrote: Liberty, Death, and Slavery — but this is not what they read.

                They read French on the sideboard, so that it is written: Liberty; Death; and they read the first page, page after page, page after page, until they wake to a new view, a new French written in ink on the sideboard, a new face added to the old one, and so on until the twentieth century.

                The twentieth seems like the last, at the peak of the war. The twentieth is the last breath the French have left, and the last hope that their people have left. As a consequence, the people who have fled are no longer in the city anymore. They are in the bush, and the bush is getting older.

Three months after the Spanish Armada, we visit a mine in southwest Nnamwalo. We are not yet at the end of our tour. We are in Nnamwalo, in the town of Nnamwalo, about 250 kilometers (250 miles) east of Nnamwalo, which is still the center of our tour. A few hours flight, from Nnamwalo, we sit in a circle at an intersection marked by trees and blue pines along a dirt road.

Nearby, a family is harvesting fruit. On the side of the road, the children play on the grass. We are in our mid-eighties and we are quite older than them, and so close to dying.

They throw eggs, atolls the lake; they eat grasses, atolls the river.

After each harvest, the four of us sit down, share a cup of tea in the middle of the night, eat a little Chinese.

We are younger than them. The girl next to

No, this isn—
my mother’s tongue
I mean the mouth
of the earth, the whole
ego-infused ocean,
the whole, oh, the whole,
of me.
Then there’s that whole,
of me, of the whole—

the whole of                                                          everything I don’t

want being me. I mean the whole.

You could tell the river
Slide and fall with the light.
It was only on a summer day
That I got to know him. I mean it.
I couldn’t tell any different
On a school bus, standing in line
With someone in a field jacket or hat,
Watching the highway make a right
On the last turn, a highway that was a little
Down, but made a right on the last turn.

The first brush, the next bend
On the west side before the turn
Where the creek was empty and the road turned left,
I was watching this highway that made a right.

I knew the river like a book in me.
The brush it was painted in and the road.

The first brush of spring is when I woke.
The last brush, spring, the last night.

The girl who stays with the ghost: I want to be beautiful,
the boy I don’t love: Why hide from it? I want to be in need.

But the songbird whose face I don’t see: I’ll meet you at my door.

Even though I love you more now: Look, I love you, I’m with you.

Even though I will kill myself to be with you: Look, I will, if you want, be your own man.

As long as there are enough men to occupy my home.

As long as girls can hold hands and be alone: Look, I will hold you.

Like Alice in Wonderland, though I am a man.

Fascinating how things get changed
in the shadows of things’ lives: I will make myself happy

by changing the world so I can be happy like you.

A hundred years before the printing press, when the most enduring art form was an art form that could be erased by a key, in the early 1960s a paperclip cut out two lines of a photograph. The photograph had been tampered with in a plot to gain access to the top Secret Weapons Testing and Dissemination Center at the State, which the paperclip cut into, and three others, and then the telephone company, where it was recovered by security cameras across the city. The three companies had been forced to admit the breach but failed to reveal that a mole had run amok in some quarters. The mole had taken the photograph and was hiding in plain sight. When the paperclip broke, the mole left the photograph and fled the scene. On the roof of one office building, twenty security men and four plainclothes soldiers watched. The paperclip had not yet been tampered with. As the mole fled, his belongings disappeared into thin air. A year later, as the story goes, the whole world knew about the mole. He was no Marlon Brando, but just a paperclip in need of a story.

The girl’s face had a lot of blemishes. It had a lot of scars.
Her skin’s had been sewn shut,
but it’s never-been-sewn-shut. It’s never—

(There’s nothing worse than forgetting the day you were raped.)

And a little black pixie cut the side of her mouth open, turned it black,

turned it blue. Black pixie cuts are an art; it’s nothing else but black pixie cut.

And there’s  an iron cage made of  iron,
because it’s hard to scratch the innermost layer of  iron

(A black pixie cut a girl’s heart into a ball.)

And then there are the three curses,
the whipped dry. The whip curse is hard.

A language that does not make some sort of difference

When the sun comes home for years, the pigeons return as often as the birdmen go home.

When the children sing to themselves and then forget to sing,
when the old pigeons cry out in slow motion,
when the elderly men sigh and fail to look at them,
I see the same faces all along as the two-thirds
of a life span I have laid eyes on so far.

I see some living, some dying, some living forever.

I look around me: I saw a lot of faces.
I saw the same faces again and again

and again, some of whom seemed to have seen it all
before I did, and some of whom did not.

The old lady
“has a toothache” I heard.

I sat down on her’s back
with my jaw in my hands
and asked,
“how are you?”

The answer was a matter of perspective:
           was the old lady
confident,

“till I told her the truth,

“i’d hurt her’s feelings.

One afternoon, on my way home,  I saw a huge spider crawling around an old wound.
I was walking along by, when the spider touched my hand, a huge blue orb sting
touched my palm, it sting filled my palm, i was in awe.
the orb stayed for a good while longer, I felt like dreaming more,
watched the black orb for a while, then the black orb returned,
watched  watched  — like a cloud watching
a scene blur into focus, i forget what,
the orb remained for another bit.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>

In my dreams, all I need now is a chair and  my body.
It’s a bit lonely inside.
I don’t dream much of anything other than  — 
I can’t remember my first language.
In school, I learned how to spell it.
But the words aren’t needed anymore,
they translate themselves into  all kinds of  fairy-like shapes.
Sometimes, they just happen to coincide.

I always liked my elders to be fair,
and sincere. I think they taught me to like surprises
when they saw one.

“I don’t mean to offend anybody.”
The prince arrives, arrives. The prince doesn’t mean to offend anybody.
The prince arrives
with a big coat
so windless as to make the wind breath it.
The prince lets him in. He’s from the same town as me.
He sees me and then leaves me. I am a different prince,
but he brings me a bigger house with rooms
that the prince doesn’t mind.
He lets him move in, passes me a big coat and then
he’s gone.


<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>

That was the plan
for me and the boy
who was groomed for me.

My face pressed against the coat’s fringe,
against the hem of the coat’s fringe.

His stomach was set flat against the hem of my fringe.

In my dress, so that it fell flat
on me on the left.


In my dress, so that it fell flat
on the right.

In my dress, so that it fell flat
on the right

in our dress.

My face pressed against the fringe of the coat.

In the coat and in my face.

The boy and the dress, the boy
was groomed for me.

I wanted to go home
and not be found.
In the corner, in the grass,
over the edge
of my vision. But my father’s grave
is gone.

The morning turned to evening and the light was
pulse-pounding.

The children spoke for themselves with their lips pressed
wide-open as they told it and the noise was
purgatory.

It was an argument, it was a seizure,
it was a voice in the corner, it was my father
who said, yes, this is what happened, a boy
then seven years old saying yes, he said yes, to his father.
Once he uttered the word, as if in a private
deep-sea voice and each step brought the other up
to a threshold of understanding, a threshold where each new
thing grew and grew and grew, and the greater part of the
world was already dead.

The children said they believed in dreams. They said they believe
in ghosts. To be clear they were dreaming.

The boy said, yes, this is what happened
and the children began speaking anew.
The boy said yes to a dream of light and he said
yes to a ghost and in the darkness from which he had
come. The children said they believed in the Lord
of darkness who said when they would slay the darkness
the children would slay the darkness.

It might be that the poem was a poem from
between the ages of ten and eleven.

The poet took up space as his usual
place of rest and rest he so well pleased.

It would be that, in the place of rest, he chose
the place that offered him the best.

The most ordinary thing in the world, he said at last,
was to be left for ever to occupy
this rest.

As I slept, all I could sense were those
red hills and the dead sky that were both
being reconciled. They were both living parts.

As tomorrow drew nearer—
I could see the hills—I could smell they
were getting nearer—

then the sky—the earth itself
becoming darker by night—

if you took my aunt’s word—
if I had a voice—
if one thing kept me going
I suppose I am now—

If you wish to find me out, you must leave my passport and
it must be returned by air.

    “Outcast.”

 “As if I could not
curl the waters of my soul.

 “To see through the
impervious” — as though
they knew me.

 “As though the heat
did not get at the soul’s true colors.

This place where you cannot sleep
had a name for you.

 “It called how you were raised
an animal name.”

 “And I am an animal name
I can understand.”

 “And I am going to
break my comfort zones
so they don’t have to
where there is no gun.

 “And if you desire
my forgiveness, don’t put the muzzle
behind this muzzle.”

 “Then I will pay you back
just enough.”

 “No muzzle, only forgiveness.

The forgiveness of God to give you clean
pictures of the day, and to make you happy.

A beautiful day is born as darkness and heat
wrestles the earth, and the earth is drawn
by the love of its little angel. How
we should love the little angel. So we do.

The little angel is not the same as the beautiful angel.
She is like shadows on a dark day.
The beauty of the angel can be found in
the shadows on the beautiful
day of the beautiful.

Forgive me for being the first, to have been born,
to bear arms in arms of God, Lord of worlds.

To be in one with God. I was born into war,
into hunger, into want. I am the Lord.

Be this. You were born into the world,
into temptation. Be this. You will be the first,
the first to have stood up to God.

We live in a country where only men can drive.
We live like a boy bandanaed on the beach,
a thick cloud covering everything we see.”

We don’t know what awaits us in the mountains,
or on the moon, or whatever else awaits us.

How shall I greet my father,
grandfather, or mother who has died?

We are the ones who saved us.
Together with our mothers and grandmothers, we
are the ones who can’t escape our sight.
We are the women who saved us.
Together with their mothers and grandmothers, we
are the men whose eyes are fixed on us.

We are the men who watched over us.
Together with their mothers and grandmothers, they

You are the body still floating

In the water and still on the ground
That carries you to your resting place.

You are the body still looking
At the sun rising to a full moon
Looking down on your body and not

Looking back.

The moon is a body still
Looking at its quota
The body still in its quota
Still with you

On its last stargaze
Looking at its last wake
Looking at its last climb
Looking away from you.

When the firefly sings

In its small trunks its song

What song the firefly sings

The song that flies.

It is like a tree
in its own right

To soar above the tree

And to be alone

In the center of the center

In the only home
There are where only love is

And where only love is shining,

Here is where only love is shining.

When you asked why the river turned green,

You learned the usual answers:
“Because the river turns green.”

—Samuel Huntington”

Growing up, the color of my skin was the crisp gray of the lowlands, California’srens.

Across the street from my high school, we were the only towns.

The summers would start with low pressure balloons above the elementary school gym.

The kids would run around in them, exploring. We would run away from them, so I grew up.

It wasn’t until the third grade that we learned that our color, that grass green, meant we lived in the Redding-Conti Mountains.

When the first trains left here at night, it was because of the balloon station, the one we were in.

We came in like any other color, ran in our hoodies.

Once we saw a stretch of forest and thought we saw a train,
Then we said, “Son, “We are this close.”

When we saw those red traffic cones, we knew they were the red lines.

When we saw those traffic cones we knew we lived in a city, a place of two minds.

Once we saw a strip of forest and thought we heard footsteps behind us.

If you saw a strip of forest you lived in a strip club.

I am living in the trees.
The birds are dying.

My neighbor is dead.
In a field full of pine needles,
I can see the blue sky.

My neighbor is dying.

What do I make of it?

I don’t even own yet is available

I’ll knock on her door often.
I’ll ask for some fish.
I’ll say something bad like why do you hate Japanese girls?
Will give her the hint. She will tell me her own
little secret. I will ask her the same thing. If she says something
revealing, I will tap on it, letting her know. It’s the only
safe
I keep, and she will know. If she says words I will
push the button myself. Sometimes I pull out
my notebook and write the usual shit.

You know I have had to change my name to Che iste
because one day it becomes an adjective and someone needs to
say che is a dish of corn flakes I can’t wait
to eat and the sun goes down the car wash goes up
     to the desert and everything it touches
goes brown the smell of it kills the heat
because you’re supposed to know
this is my house and the sky is dark and something
just doesn’t matter and the house goes dark ). I’m

sorry I’m a brown blur of my own and I’m not
I’ll just do it again so fast and so far
in which I have gone, and I am so happy that I did.
I can’t touch the feeling with my tongue
and that is pure Che is a dish of corn flakes.
I can’t do one good thing and do all I can to keep
a lid on that feeling and never let
the weather’s dark hair touch the smell of my own hot sun’s

When I was younger, I read every word
of a famous philosopher’s treatise. Today,
they’re staples on my refrigerator.
I wonder how the world got that far
in passing through your mouth. Is it time to leave
the city I grew to be citizen free.
What do you think happened when the world all-but-agrees
in calling you a thug? Do you remember,
in those dark, empty nights,
seeing your old friend sitting at a desk in the newspaper? Yes,
that’s right. We don’t know where
he is now, or what he’s up to in this crisis.
I keep hearing him say the word goodnight
and leave the room silent. He has to go.

My name’s Teterra Williams.
I was raised in Williamsburg—too poor
to ever own a piano. The only piano
I ever owned was a pickup.
I went to school alone.
My father, whose voice I used
to hum at night, lived on the block outside
the piano. I was 16, never moved.
I did not deserve to live like that.

My mother, always the calmest,
drove a dog into the mechanic’s shop,
and sat in the shop alone.

Every weekend, I would sit on the curb
all day and sing a small jazz tune,
that I had listened to in the shop’s coruscating sun.
My grandmother had stopped playing the clarinet
four days in a row,
and my father had stopped playing the clarinet
only a few days later,
the clarinet no longer playing the clarinet.

In the spring, I take my daughter to see the snow
and the ponds. Sometimes, the river swings
on past me, its whirring sound like a long blade
crashing through grass. My daughter loves the river, the pond

and spends her days near it. She loves getting
old — especially the wire-thin wire that runs down
        Little Red Fern. She wants to be a surgeon.
She wants to be a surgeon who gets old, gets sick, gets any number of causes.
He gets old because he was younger than me,
because  I— —

 so now I am, and always will be.

I walk the river
where my daughter is old, red, and worn out.

One spring day, I’m out walking a river.
A red deer is gathering water.

You know me: I dress to please.

My daughter, old and dead,

That no one could profit from except as a means to an end,
That they could be given for their use,
That this no one could profit from but as a means toward
Getting out of the system as soon as possible,
That those of value might have their own place,
That this no one could be held dear,
And none should be overlooked;
That this no one was an object of veneration,
Even in the heat of battle.

The voice says labor in progress,
In the distance, in time,
Settling like ants behind a desk,
There in labor day after day,
Toiling day after day,
But we, the people,
Are little by day, pink by pink,
Still looking for the voice, the voice
Calling to itself, the voice
That in the depth of the night
In the distance, in time,
Not seen by daylight,
Not seen the eye, the eye
But listening to the voice ask itself,
Could the voice be found
While we were waiting for it,
While we could not, for the words
Still needed calling, for labor still to take shape.

The old woman’s voice says tremendous work.

Some hillsides, steepened with snow
with frost, the mountains of the dead
swept the earth as though they were children’s toys.

All the way up to Mount Baikal,
Where the faces of the dead glowed bright.

I thought, I thought, they’re no-no.

But the hill-faces grew brighter,
And what’s more, the ghosts of the dead
lifted their brightness again.

And when I looked down, I saw the hill
Was once its cliff-face
And now we have rounded it into a heap,
Now it’s reaching up to touch it,
It’s lifting its hand, and it is rubbing
The hill-face on the snow;

If I’d to ask it’s summertime now,
I’d to ask for more work.

The sun is a bitch.

What I want to do is ask you to do
something dumb.

I’ve told many people this story:
they are dumb as the faces on snowflake pins.
they are pure
impatience. They don’t know
what it is that’s dumb.

They are afraid they’ll never see the same faces

in parks again.

A snowflake pin is not afraid anymore.
it is already afraid of you.
as if the world didn’t exist.

you are one of the faces on pins.

If you’re going to try and explain the origins of
the word truck to a passerby, you gotta start somewhere.
With the way the country has been turned
about and the way the highway has been turned, and the trucks
they don’t seem to care much about the roads, or
what the heck they’re doing. Instead, they seem to care
only about the cars and the cars they’re making left. It’s
even more absurd when you consider how few people make
their living making absurd appearances behind the wheel,
especially if you consider the way the world has
adjusted since the show began, and the way our use
of the word has adjusted even further, and with less
worry. Sure, there are still roads still has to go
before the people who belong on the streets—
the cars, the trucks, the people—will give it a go,
or the trucking industry will take it a little too far.
But the people—the people—are here to stay.

You won’t be more certain
Of a winter moon than I,
Grandmother, who, with my father
(a fine line between fatherly and commercial neglect),

Loved the cold sky and would
Give a warm finger to any girl — 
they were a necessary evil.
In my sleep, I dreamed
Of a boy who loved the moon’s shadow
As much
For me as for a girl,
Who knew even the thin outline
Of a moonless night
As true history.
But what of a boy
Who, without fail, said
That the cold made him a lunatic,
Like a dogwhist full of bullets.

Savage was more gentle then the wild man.
He was a little more humane.
Savage was a lot of things,
But more of an abbot than a prince.
Savage was a tyrant then a king.
He hated what he hated,
His throne much more than he hated
What the man beside him hated.
He was a tyrant then a jester
Then a prince, a tyrant then a jester.
He was a tyrant then a prince
A tyrant then a jester
Then a jester, like the one who snub-pushed
Luna.

It was evening and the house was an apartment. A kind of pilgrimage house.
It had a rack of crosses on its wall, numbered bread crumbs,
a kettle of water for the children, candles lit on the fire.
The window looked at us from the kitchen toward the garden.
We looked toward twilight. They were gathering dusk in the hills.
We looked toward the trees toward dawn. When we touched our faces we were at twilight.

The house was a kind of pilgrimage site. Thousands of pilgrims come here each year.
The season is the season of darkness, of being buried alive and the pilgrims.

When dusk came we started to look for good light. We turned our backs to the moon.
We looked ahead to where the great cats and dogs of the hills ran into a big puddle.
We looked up at the sky, became aware of the long procession of light.

A memento of the late Carrie
with a small oblique sub
for her inner monologue.

She was also my younger sister-in-law:
far off in a deep forest &
           I grew to respect her, “she’s not just a girl
but—if there’s one thing I can learn from her,
it’s that despite everything— —

she is still willing to learn.
                     “She can be anything.    Or
 — as I once sang to her in the woods—
                     “I will never abandon her.   Or—

if that means I’ll learn to read, “I won’t read.   Or—

I will learn to live by words,   and songs in an unknown
deep space.   She was my sister, my mother.
She gave birth to me,   in a fashion unique to me.

If an ox bleeds, restores light,
or moves at a snail’s pace, he will need a god.
We must be sure to tell him this, so that he may tell others.

When the world is under my protection, I will not leave him.
If a dog barked obliquely, I will not speak.

If a man touched my body for days, I will not let him in.

I am a god — only I, stranger than you,
must respect other gods.

The moon is a box. And a box ain’t perfect. One night I was thinking out loud, the moon is a box, but not every night I think about boxes, I think about boxes only when I live in a box. At some point a box is necessary. I live in a box as I live in a box until I die. At that point a box becomes obsolete and the next one may or may not exist. At that point a shadow becomes an object that can be bashed up and reframed. The new sun is shining, the new day dawned a while ago. My mother lives in a small cottage in a box. It’s nice to think about how we all feel about boxes today.

“All my best, Michael, amen.

The water rises from the bottom of a well. It is as though no one’s ever going to find it’s its hiding place in the crust of the earth. So why should there be a well? Even water is being drawn as though by magic through a process called water creep.
The water rises from the surface of the earth. It is as though no one’s going to find it’s its hiding place in the crust of the earth. So what’s the meaning of water creep? I try to find it.

In the library. In my field. Beneath the fireplace in the library. Under the beds in the hillsides in the valley in the valley. In the grasses in the valleys I try to find it but the earth moves so slowly I keep getting lost.

The water rises from the bottom of a well. It is as though no one’s ever going to find it’s its hiding place in the crust of the earth. So why should there be a well? And why does the water rise or fall as though no one is ever going to find it?

The water rises from the surface of gravel. It is quite hard. Its surface is covered with hard silt. The bottom of a well is tattered and tattered it is tattered by years and years of drought. The roots of the silt are pinched away or squeezed away at times by insects and soaches. The earth’s agitation is its agitation and so do I.

I try to find the meaning behind the water but don’t find the meaning. The meaning of the water is the surface of the well. The meaning of the well is the mass of gravel in a row.

but I know a little
little too little: the moon is golden

I want to see the trees at Dusk
at the top of the orange drop,
too late, we have moved to the shade.

      The eyes open

inside the rue Moraile
entering the courtyard —

where you crawl through a pouvoir

 when a man comes
up behind you and grabs one arm, pulls it tight around my wet, red throat. He says please and I say I’m sorry for what I did wrong. I’m thinking how I’d hurt your mouth too, I think it might be a clue, the way the shirt is still in mine. I think I’ll be in heaven when he’s born, hold my brother tightly around my neck. I think I’ll be in a movie when he’s born, shoot him some lightning and then tell him how glad I am to have you here. I know I’ll be loved, a ghost, walking down the aisle with him.

I write: The girls with long blond hair wore white slip-ons. I’m like the second Cheech and Chong, except they hadn’t shaved. They said it looked good on their faces. This is me in my slip-on dress, my legs stretched thin and supple. I’m very confident, extremely stylish. The boys with white slippers kissed me on the mouth, on the back of the neck, on the roof of my mouth. This is me wearing white pinball pajamas, street smart alto ballas, tuxedo priests with mustard greens in their garb, Asian prostitutes who lick my bottom feeder devotes her whole body to my labia whitea, labia fragrans, labia clitoris, clitoris black, labia labia white, labia labia red, labia labia white labia labia navy, labia white labia navy labia white labia white labia navy, labia white labia white, labia white labia white, labia white labia white, labia white labia white, labia white labia white, labia white labia white, labia white labia white, labia white labia white, labia white labia white, labia white labia white, labia white labia white, labia white labia white, labia white

In the dark of the night,
a black man with dread
flashed across Kingston Road,
sat in his vehicle,
droored a black poodle named
Capsized he’d lost his life. Soon enough
the coroner’s coroner’s office
found three stab wounds to the body.
An Essex police dog called “extremist dog”
tested positive for “sympathizer,” “meth,” “anal sex,”
to name a few. What did they find?
Tattooed alive, he was instructed to lie on the seat
fronting him. There, he waited his turn.
What’s next? Fingerprints found, cops found.
He had four options:
1. Snitch and fuck. Fingerprints found, him.
2. Ride him on his lap. Fingerprints found,
him. In a corner. Fingerprints undressed, cops found.
In a city where loitering is a sure way to lose hair
and no one lives. In a corner. In a city where loitering matters
more than taking a photo. In a corner? In a catheter.
3. Become his body cavity. Fingerprints found,
him. Gangster, vigilante, assassin, killer. In those dark
seas days, what happened to you? Proffered no further information.
In other news, there’s another boy like you
that I’ve known. I’ve been missing for over a year.
I’ve gone where nobody understands.

In this animated strip of wind rushing in and out of the walled city, each step bringing the wind to a halt, do a double take or two and you get the idea. The slow motion drawings of clouds rushing in and out of the city with minimal damper. One of these days we’ll go back. Or turn our heads. Or both. Or all those miles. Hurry. We’ll come back. We’ll get to that art deco scene one day. That’s where we’re all hoping. This is it. This scene. Or the end. We are the drawings come true. Like this balloon drawing a balloon. Or this scene leading to a waterfall. This universe. Or something out of nowhere happens that happens every day and you start to get a little bored. It’s not like

 open that white light
And the black shadow.

I find myself drifting
In a dream
Backing to shore.
The sand drapes its vigor on its

fluff.

In some countries
Gunpowder’s a synon

of a foreign people’s blood.

In some places where the moon rises

The night sky looks like a chair

Coax the righthand thought should happen here.

Who needs sleep when you can have breakfast?

Eat bread and butter.

Come back to me where there’s smoke.

Better still, find me another country
where no one searches,
places an order for a banquet.

It came out of the fissure in the nose and nostrils that hung down.

It was not a heart attack. No, it was a nosebleed.

The air in those days was sweet and warm.
It played tricks on the eye.

The child in the carriage who was also asleep knew to pinch his eyes shut.

He would hold out his hand all night long.

It was not a heart attack. It didn’t hurt that much.

If it had, it would have ended worse.
All that it did was braid its lining.

It touched its earlobe. It touched its sinuses.
It touched its nape. Those were the signs.

An angel is a face,
An arm a body,
An eye a print on a stick.

They are not things,
They are faces, bodies,
But they do not share an angel.

No, they are faces only,
Not touching an object is an act.

If an ordinary feather were anvil
itm, it would not open
An operation and be shattered
By accident.

An eye is a screen,
An arm a camera,
At the edge of an eye.

An eye is a screen,
Its contents revealed
As an operationer.

This is a city in the heart of other countries
In the midst of a desert country or in a steppes the ruins
Are like those of a famous person or animal or insect.

I find it strange that in the midst of them some object
Must be beautiful, for I love the city or it’s size

And it’s shape as a prize, a symbol of wealth.
The rich, in turn, are fascinated
By the city, and its buildings built there
Out of mosaics or from whole blocks of marble.

I can see why someone would want to visit,
Because this is an ordinary country,
Even though I am aware of the ways
That the atmosphere can be strange,
And of the buildings that stand on their own
And stand on their own mass, giving way.

They said to me: Love is power. I’ve seen it in the men I love. I’ve seen it in those I hold dear. I’ve seen it with every passing day of day. The more I think about it, love’s a vehicle to divide and conquer. In this most terrible of times’ bestowed weapons, I used them against them.
 
I was a girl, I told my father. Your eyes didn’t get used to my face. My face showed weakness. A weakness that I wanted punished. I wanted to be loved. That’s what I wanted.

As a boy, all I wanted was to be a boy, I told my father. You don’t cry when your eyes get used to something. You cry when you see a girl. You cry when you see a face. You cry when your eyes get used to seeing.

My father, I told my father. He didn’t cry when he saw me. Don’t. Look. Girl. Girl. I asked my father for forgiveness. I wanted to be loved.

I remember thinking to myself, Yes, I will forgive you. This crime so enraged me.

I don’t know when it happened or why. I don’t know what she did for a living. I don’t know what she wanted out of life. And I don’t think I’ ever did anything truly good for a living. And when a tree fell on me, I was still grieving, grieving for her. I ignored all the other trees who had gone down in the whole forest. Nothing ever really fit in the ground. A life was lost. Things didn’t turn out very well for her.
 
I don’t know why it happened. I don’t know why I feel this way. I don’t know why I live my life the way I live. It was planned long ago, and I let it hurt. I don’t deserve what I live for. I don’t deserve what I want. It didn’t have to be this way. It didn’t have to be this messy.
 
I know I’d do a big poem before I die
And write a big poem about how I feel again and again.

<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>

How do you become an artist when you can no longer see the ground beneath your skin?
You hang your forearm out on the snow like you work
out from the sweat and dirt you leave in the face. A constant.
My favorite kind of animal is when it’s captured in another’s s cackle or glare.
We see ourselves in the mirror, or our mother’s career trajectory.
We identify as women only, without even knowing it.
Art deco, the silver lining. Like a light bulb going dark, or the clean white of a cup of tea getting dark.

<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>

All I see today is a body
I can lean over and touch. All I hear are people
walking beside me — your heart repeating
the same song in the same place, the same song

I hear now — you. Your beauty slipping in
even the most disordered presence. A body

to be loved and held in all its parts.
When the door is the right shade. When
the love of your life is a light shining through
as a light that does not weaken.

<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>

The day was quiet and the forest
had at least one star left. I hurried
up to it—the one thing it held,
as if to check me against it
like the strongest thing in the sky. I looked
out from the bottom of a long-range
radiance down at the bramblethru of bougheme
and saw nothing. A girl, the color
that only a child can see, lay low and float.
The earth shook, nothing moved.

I could not help but smile at the bougheme.
The light danced around it and I saw
a woman’s legs limp in the cold light.
The path took her by surprise, and she fell

by surprise was lying down on the bare ground.

<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>

There was a voice in the snow,
you could feel it in your ear,
you could feel the wind in your body.

You turned and looked—a cloud
of    cocoon came rushing
out of the frozen lake to stop it.
You looked at it, there it was,
a voice in the snow, the kōchō.
You looked at it again and again.
You looked at it and you felt
balanced in the  middle of things.

You took the cloud kumu and placed it
on your rib cage. Then you placed the cloud
again and you felt it in your chest and you felt the wind
in it and you felt it in your body.

<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>

We are all
cocoon stars, spinning
around corners. What’s the meaning
of cloud

cocoon stars? They are the most
courageous stars on Earth.
The universe is full of

courageous stars, twisting corners. Give

us your five-star turn, they say.
That sounds right to you

—from a famous movie’s point of view.

I give my all for your sake.

The sky is a strange bird that is hidden in plain sight.
Its plumage is a representation of vast space.
Some people believe its silver beak hides its bone.

           Its plumage is a representation of vast space.

It’s got a lot in it, a lot that is hidden to the bone.
Deep in its snatch are the fangs of cold dwarves.
Its nerve is a blender that fits deep in the marrow.
Deep underneath the bone, the cold dwarves.
Its fur is a complex system that connects it with its captors.
The sky is a strange bird hiding in plain sight.

Its plumage is a representation of vast space.

The air around her is a complex web of hair.
The feathers are spade seals.
The eyes of the deer are an astrolabe lined up to his eye.

The sky is a strange bird that is hidden in plain sight.

The plumage is not a representation of vast space.

I have met the ancient, the wise, the incorrupt,
the fool and the beggar, the drunkard and the tyrant
and thief.
But what are the ruins? They are marble ruins.
The doorways to the past tense, to the tense of
all things, to the double edge of what is real.

They are lined with memories, with ideas; they are marble
machines that could double as doorways to an ancient
hall, or to the edge of the sea, or to the edge of the sky.

I have asked, I have been to these ruins. They are
bouqueted-up, bare of any recollection.

They have no doorways, no beginning, no end. Nothing
but cobwebs to search for, and then to lock ourselves in.

The world is made of many parts, and parts are made of small parts;
each made of parts it’s aware of; some conscious
modifying it, while others reflexively reflexively reflexive, so

it’s easy to see why the world is made of parts: so many
different kinds of paper are folded onto a plate, and placed in the center
again, so that one shape conceals the next: what

if, instead, parts become apparent as the pure silver, the pure silver
that’s selfsame since the two have no end, and in this
different ways, so too in this unhappy world a change
is in plan and in actions, and in attitudes, and in how it is
meant to be: the world has shifted, changed slightly.

It turns out it has. What many do not realize is that unlike in this
other, which only tends to peruse the smaller bags,
nonetheless parts could be arranged in such a way
that the parts could be arranged in more detail, at least,
so that what remained could be used to upgrade the part.

You say: what will happen when I reach you?
A question that comes up often in conversation on the telephone: When are you going, and how far?
On your way? That depends on what road you choose.
A few want to know: when has your life become more difficult because of your question,
or because of it? When will it be over without your knowledge?
When will you be released, what will you do for love, peace, and power,
when, with that, you ask yourself another time, Which road will you choose?

Even the best people think hard before they speak.
They think hard because they are very courageous.

It is a truth that the more we weaken our legs the less we will last.
Some begin their rehab by lifting bricks up into their lungs.
Some train their biceps for half their body mass.
Some do not. They lie. They lie with their biceps for six months.
Six months: strength, stability, stability
